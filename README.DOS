
As of today (3 March 1998) I've removed the 
Win95/NT executables from this distribution, sorry.

You can still get an executable from 
http://www.muraroa.demon.co.uk, or (as a last
resort) by mailing me at jseward@acm.org.

The reason for this change of packaging is that it
makes it easier for me to fix problems with specific
executables if they are not included in the main
distribution.
